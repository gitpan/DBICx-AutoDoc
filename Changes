Revision history for Perl extension DBICx::AutoDoc.

0.03  Tue Nov 20 14:47:01 EST 2007
    - Added a -I option to dbicx-autodoc, so you can document schemas that
      aren't in @INC.
    - Fixed the argument processing for dbicx-autodoc a bit.
    - Corrected a dumb bug in DBICx::AutoDoc->output_filename that made
      output always go to the current directory.
    - Added examples to the distribution, so they will show up on CPAN.
    - Added documentation to dbicx-autodoc.
    - Added some missing dependencies to Makefile.PL

    - Fixed the MANIFEST, first time releasing with Module::Install, and
      the first time I used ShipIt, combined they made me break the release. :)
